## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Upload Process**:
   ```
   User Upload → Backend Validation → ChatPDF API → Source ID → Frontend Storage
   ```

2. **Chat Process**:
   ```
   User Message → Backend → ChatPDF API → AI Response → Frontend Display
   ```

3. **Cleanup Process**:
   ```
   Delete Request → Backend → ChatPDF API → File Cleanup → UI Update
   ```

### State Management

- **Conversations State**: Array of conversation objects with messages
- **Current Conversation**: Active conversation for chat interface
- **Upload State**: Loading states and error handling
- **UI State**: Tab selection, input values, and display states

### Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms and user feedback
- **API Errors**: Detailed error messages from ChatPDF API
- **Validation Errors**: File type, size, and format validation
- **Authentication Errors**: Proper handling of expired tokens

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

**Backend (.env)**:
```env
CHATPDF_API_KEY=sec_your_api_key_here
```

### API Key Setup

1. Sign up for ChatPDF account
2. Generate API key from account settings
3. Add key to backend environment variables
4. Restart backend server

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Navigate to AI Assistant**: Access via main navigation
2. **Choose Upload Method**: Select File or URL tab
3. **Upload PDF**: Either select file or enter URL
4. **Start Chatting**: Ask questions about the uploaded PDF
5. **Manage Conversations**: Use sidebar to switch between PDFs
6. **Clean Up**: Delete conversations when no longer needed

### For Developers

1. **Setup API Key**: Follow the setup guide
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure form-data is installed
3. **Test Endpoints**: Verify all API endpoints work correctly
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any API errors or issues

## Performance Considerations

### File Size Limits
- Maximum PDF size: 32MB
- Maximum pages: 2,000
- Automatic file cleanup after processing

### API Limits
- Maximum 6 messages per request
- Token limit: 2,500 OpenAI tokens
- Rate limiting handled by ChatPDF

### Memory Management
