# General Compliance Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive general compliance management system that allows users to track various compliance documents and renewals with due dates. The system now properly saves records to the database and provides full CRUD functionality.

## Database Changes

### New Table: `general_compliance_records`
```sql
CREATE TABLE general_compliance_records (
  id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  compliance_type ENUM('tax_return', 'license_renewal', 'certification', 'registration', 'permit', 'insurance', 'audit', 'report', 'other') NOT NULL,
  due_date DATE NOT NULL,
  expiry_date DATE,
  renewal_date DATE,
  frequency ENUM('once', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'annually', 'biennially', 'custom') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'once',
  status ENUM('active', 'pending', 'overdue', 'completed', 'expired') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  priority ENUM('high', 'medium', 'low') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium',
  assigned_to VARCHAR(36),
  department_id VARCHAR(36),
  created_by VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  
  FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
